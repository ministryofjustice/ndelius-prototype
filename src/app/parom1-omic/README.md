# Parole Report - Parom 1 (OMIC) 

---

:warning: **This is *NOT* production code and is used entirely for the rapid prototyping of new features for user testing.**

---

## Completing a report

The Parom 1 (OMIC) report differs from other reports in the prototype in that it is completed by two separate user journeys.

In order to generate a complete report the *POM* journey must be completed in order to generate the final report as part of the *COM* journey.

In order to achieve this, you should complete the *POM* journey but **DO NOT** select the **Close this report** link on the final page as this will clear the stored data.

Instead you must select the *Home* link in the mock *nDelius* menu on the left and return to the Parom 1 (OMIC) journey in order to continue as the *COM*.

## State

Application state is cleared when **Close this report** is selected on the *Save draft* or the *Report complete* page.
