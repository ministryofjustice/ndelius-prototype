          <li>A holistic analysis, from liaison with all relevant prison staff, of the prisoner’s positive and negative behaviour while in prison. Record this chronologically.</li>
          <li>Changes in behaviour and offence paralleling behaviours, for example, bullying when there is a history of manipulation and the impact this may have on risk.</li>
          <li>Prison and security information such as adjudications, drug tests, wing reports, the IEP scheme and the MAPPA F (include that the panel have agreed that it is disclosable).</li>
          <li>Do not comment on whether you believe any allegations or security intelligence are true or false. You should assess any impact the behaviours could have on the assessment if they were true or false. If you are unsure or are concerned that comments could lead to legal challenges, speak to PPCS.</li>
          <li>Positive and negative behaviour linked to letters, telephone calls and visits the prisoner has received. This can provide an understanding of their support network or potential risk concerns. For example, visits from children, people who have a history of abusive or manipulative behaviour, or where there is a restraining order in place.</li>
          <li>The reasons for, and impact of unavailable information.</li>
          <li>An awareness of unconscious bias, stereotyping and diversity - to ensure that you do not inappropriately represent the prisoner’s race, socio-economic background, culture or religious beliefs as concerning. For example, assuming association with a faith is a cover for illegal behaviour.</li>
          <li>An awareness of disguised  or superficial compliance – when the prisoner gives the appearance of co-operation to do things like avert suspicion, allay professional concerns or avoid interventions.</li>
          <li>The prisoner’s opinion on, and explanation for their behaviour. If the prisoner refused to engage, you should state this.</li>

          <li><strong>Eligible</strong> - an analytical explanation, dates for resettlement day and overnight release and where they are working or residing - link this to the sentence plan. Include Police or MAPPA consultation.</li>
          <li><strong>Undertaking</strong> - an explanation of progress and concerns - record past or future RoTL dates and venues. Include Police or MAPPA consultation.</li>
