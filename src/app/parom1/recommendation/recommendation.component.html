          <li>Clear and succinct reasons for your recommendation that flow logically from the main body of your report - this will strengthen your point of view. The Parole Board will consider your recommendation, but they will make an independent assessment and decision.</li>
          <li>Consideration of all previous offending behaviours.</li>
          <li>Consideration of the risk the prisoner would present if released under the proposed RMP.</li>

          <li>Consideration of Information and assessments provided by psychology and prison staff.</li>
          <li>An agreed HMPPS recommendation, if possible. If you have a different view to the prison offender manager you should fully explore and try to resolve it before writing the report. If you cannot agree you should explain this and make your recommendation clear.</li>
          <li>Evidenced reasons for not supporting release which flow logically from the main body of your report.</li>
          <li>A detailed account of the prisonerâ€™s next steps if you are not supporting release, for example, progression pathways or a transfer to another prison to complete an intervention. Clarify when they will happen.</li>
          <li>An explanation if there are outstanding reports required to make a full decision, for example, psychology or post-programme reports - include a time frame. Should the Parole Board require an addendum, they can be made available before the oral hearing.</li>
