        <p class="margin-top">Do they accept responsibility?<br/>
          Are they in denial? If they are, be clear where lack of remorse differs from any inability to show remorse.<br/>
          Is the offender aware of the impact on the victim?</p>
        <p class="margin-top">Outline the emotional or cognitive factors that underpin the crime.<br/>
          Were there sexual motivations, financial gains or addictions?<br/>
          What level of premeditation or planning was involved?<br/>
          Are there any patterns suggesting likelihood of similar offending?</p>
        <p class="margin-top">Is there any evidence of discrimination in their attitude or behaviour?<br/>
          Is the offender’s maturity an issue in this offence - are they easily led or influenced by a peer group?</p>
        <p class="margin-top">Make suggestions about possible rehabilitative interventions.</p>
